# whohasmygames

This is a cross-platform desktop app that allows you to select multiple steam
friends and see who has the same games as you. 

## Installation

To install, you (preferably) need the latest version of `golang` and install
`fyne`. Then run the following two commands.

```
go get fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne
fyne install
```

On linux systems, you might require elevated permissions to run `fyne install`.
